## Drums Player

This application will consist of a GUI representing a drum set, wherein each 
part of the set could be controlled by keyboard to make sounds. This 
application could be used by anyone who enjoys or just wishes to play around
with drums. There is also an option to record a beat that the user is playing.
As an avid drummer, I have always had moments where I thought of a beat and
wanted to test it out right away, but couldn't as I don't carry a drumset on my
back, and later forgot about it. Creating this application would allow me to
instantly record what I was thinking of so that it could be later played.

*User Stories*:
- As a user, I want to be able to press the keys on my keyboard and hear the respective sounds
- As a user, I want to have buttons on the GUI or keys to start and stop recording the sounds
- As a user, i want to be able to save my recording somewhere in my desktop
