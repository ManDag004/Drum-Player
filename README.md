## Drums Player

This application will consist of a GUI representing a drum set, wherein each 
part of the set could be controlled by keyboard to make sounds. This 
application could be used by anyone who enjoys or just wishes to play around
with drums. There is also an option to record a beat that the user is playing.
As an avid drummer, I have always had moments where I thought of a beat and
wanted to test it out right away, but couldn't as I don't carry a drumset in my
bag. Creating this application would allow me to
instantly record what I was thinking of so that it could be later played.
